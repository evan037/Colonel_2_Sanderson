ls will list files.
ls -r will lit files in reverse order
ls -u will list files by access time
You would do this to see what files are being actively used
Through using grep and piping through unwanted characters.
Grep and piping through all alphabetical characters, leaving only numbers.
The same way, but ignoring numbers instead of letters
sort "phrase you are searching for"
For the purpose of being more specific 
the find command will locate files
find.XLS will locate XLS files
find file will locate file and provide specs
You'd do this to find a file extension name and details.
